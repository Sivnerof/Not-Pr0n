## Level 1

Level 1 is pretty straight forward. Just an image with an [html area map](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_area.asp "W3 Info On Area Tag") over the door which when clicked on leads to level 2. One interesting thing to note though is that in the HTML source code there is a comment all the way at the bottom which reads "good idea, but the source is one screen ahead of this one". This leads me to believe further levels will require reading source code.
